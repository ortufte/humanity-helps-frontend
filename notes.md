1. how am i going to add items and schedule to the donation site
2. only list sites after zip code is submitted
3. only show create form if they click a button 
4. how do I add headers for Schedule and Items in the site HTML 
5. //This function will eventually be called in an event listener on 'get sites' button after entering zipcode. 
// I will have to add a conditional for zipcode/distance. User = Donation Site. Put this in User class?
6. 
//are you accepting donations? <button>Add your Donation Site</button> - on click, form appears
//form - build it out in javascript - event listener on 'Submit Donation Site' button. - then alert user that site has/has/not been created.
